	 at POPL 2021!
		  We show how to combine a little bit of Hamming geometry with deep 
	results from exact learning theory 
		  to identify a class of systems and invariants that can be inferred
	 using only a polynomial number of calls to a SAT solver.
		  These results identify a class of relatively easy verification

		  Jay presented <a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/armada.pdf">our paper</a> about Armada at PLDI 2020.
		  Armada is a verification system for shared-memory multithreaded programs
		  that allows programmers to write verified systems whose performance matches
		  unverified counterparts, by giving them control over memory layout and choice
		  of synchronization primitives. The key insight is that high-level reasoning
		  principles from the literature can be proved sound against a low-level
		  semantic model that is expressive enough to support these programmer choices.

		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>
			I am an undergraduate researcher and teaching assistant in machine learning at the University of Washington.
			I expect to graduate in December 2023. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This is my academic homepage. I plan 
			to earn a PhD in machine learning, I'm currently improving transformer inference efficiency. 
			I am continuing to refine my interests throughout the next year. 
		</p>

		<p>
			In addition to data and matrices I enjoy music, Lego designing and animating, and meeting people. 
			I like to explore natural formations such as Yellowstone National Park, and occasionally play computer games.
			You can find me outside an academic setting at <a href="https://www.parkrun.us/perrigo/">Parkruns</a>.

			My Lego content is found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DosBrosComix">DosBrosComix</a>. 
			In Yellowstone and other national parks I like to use <a href="https://gypsyguide.com/tour/yellowstone-national-park/">GPS guided tours</a>. 
			A book I'm enjoying about effective communication is <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/">"Radical Candor"</a>.

		   My research interests are in programming languages, systems, and formal methods.
		   My thesis work was on compositional techniques for verifying distributed systems implementations.
		   I generally enjoy working with proof assistants and SMT solvers on applications to all kinds of concurrent programming.
		   I also dabble in floating point, compilers, and 3D printing.

		  <b><a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/Peterson.dfy.html">A Port of the Proof of Peterson's Algorithm to Dafny</a>.</b><br>
	
		  This code-only post is a port of the proof of Peterson's Algorithm to Dafny.
		  It also serves as a good example of how to reason about concurrent systems
		  in Dafny, essentially by writing a thread scheduler.

		  <b><a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/Counter.html">How to build a simple system in Verdi</a>.</b><br>
	
		  In this long-awaited post, we'll show how to implement and verify
		  a simple distributed system using network semantics.

		  <span class=" date-inline">May 8, 2015</span> <br>
	
		  <b><a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/SharedMem.html">A Proof of Peterson's Algorithm</a>.</b><br>
	
		  In this post, we take a break from distributed systems to look at shared
		  memory systems. As a case study, we give a proof that Peterson's algorithm
		  provides mutual exclusion.

		  <b><a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/NetworkSemantics.html">Network Semantics for Verifying Distributed Systems</a>.</b><br>
	
		  This is the first post in a series
		  on <a href="http://verdi.uwplse.org/">Verdi</a>. In this post,
		  we'll get our feet wet by defining a formal model of how
		  distributed systems execute on the network.

		  <b><a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/more-cardinality.html">Reasoning about Cardinalities of Sums and Products</a>.</b><br>
	
		  In this short, code-heavy post, we extend some of the work from
		  a <a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/dep-destruct.html">previous post</a> to reason about
		  the cardinalities of sums and products.

		  <b><a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/dep-destruct.html">Dependent Case Analysis in Coq without Axioms</a>.</b><br>
	
		  This post shows how to get around the limitations of
		  the <code>destruct</code> tactic when doing case analysis on dependent
		  types, without resorting to the <code>dependent destruction</code> tactic,
		  which relies on additional axioms.

		  writing.

		  <b><a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/mstd2.html">"More Sums than Differences" Sets, Part 2: Counting MSTD Sets</a>.</b><br>
	
		  This is the (much delayed) second post in a series on More Sums
		  than Difference Sets. In this post, we'll take a first crack at the
		  question, "How many MSTD sets are there?" To do so, we'll write a
		  straightforward C program that counts MSTD sets. Then we'll run it to
		  count MSTD sets and benchmark its performance.

		  <a href="https://jamesrwilcox.com/tail-mod-cons.html"><b>Tail Recursion Modulo</b> <span class="tt">cons</span></a>.<br>
	
		  Tail recursion has come up in a few conversations this
		  week. This post explores a generalization of tail call
		  optimization that I wasn't aware of
		  until <a href="http://dougwoos.com/">Doug</a> described it to me.

		<h2>Books</h2>
		<p>
		  I like books. I am guilty of being somewhat more of a collector than a reader, but I don't let that get me down.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		  I currently have around <a href="books.txt">120 technical books</a> in my office (listed behind that link).
		  I have another 150 or so technical books at home that are not-so-related to my research, and another 50 or so non-technical books as well.
		  Someday, I'll list them all here.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		  I am happy to lend books to anyone interested. Just let me know!
		</p>
	
		<p>
		  I am also very happy to receive recommendations of good books that I'm missing!
