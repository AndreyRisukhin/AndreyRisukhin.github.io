I'm creating reflection pages inspired by Adam Towers'.

Quarter goal: Spend meaningful time with people, intentionally interesting people.
Reflection on goal:

What went well outside of goal:
> Surprising amount of spontaneous events :-) Dinner with Alex, Noah and Ai2 (Hao, Yanai, _, _) at the seafood restaurant; Madrona IA summit; CSE research day
> Meaningful relationships initiated with ML (446) Professors and some TAs (Josh, Nick)
> Writing this on Jan 1, 2023, one day prior to new quarter. Very thankful for the break from productivity, gave me time to dive into fun activities and now re-create the structure for the next quarter. Time with Chloe was lovely :heart:

What could have been better:
> Consistent time for work (research, homework, thinking). The time slots were very variable, would be nice and easier to track consistent time spend. 
> Make more time for future with Chloe (looking at apartments, budgeting)
> Dedicated time for Nick and fun activities was absent, played video games when felt like it
> Staying in touch with people on the Excel spreadsheet, and populating the spreadsheet  (populating spreadhseets did not happen except Ai2 and IA40)

Looking forward:
> Make a better schedule from the start of quarter, include time for breaks to walk, activities with Nick and fun, and reading news/tech
