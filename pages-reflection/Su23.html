Data-driven health

Great start to the summer, excited to continue data-driven health style (vivoactive, friend videotapes me running)




cseed
DH Next, Adam enthusiasm for collab, shared valuable founding docs (links)
Really excited about a graphic to quickly help students in CS orient how to navigate entre at UW and decide where to enter based on their unique experiences

Behavior to update for the summer

Setting boundaries
    "Positive no" from How To Have A Good Day
    Hawa: "I don't believe in late replies, I believe in replying when ready."
Writing more
    Inspired by Hannah, Adam writing, Hawa's clarity when speaking (generally Hawa's philosophy)
    Writing more will help me get clarity 
    Read Noah's book recommendation on this!
Check in with people
    Get a plan to check in with folks that matter to me who I haven't interacted with in some time (M&M Vogt would love to know about BS/MS)
    



Learnings

Max produce speed is important; 
    advocate more strongly to continue writing in Python, not Typescript
    Don't spend time on seperate github account if contract has permissive IP language, use main one that's set up iwth ssh

Go slow to go fast 
    Explore in finegrained detail, document. Then use all the "inputs" and "outputs" observed, write a plan. Share this plan with leadership, get their opinion. NOW begin coding.

Force multiply




Accepted into BS/MS
This is amazing
I need experience with industry research to decide where to take career, thus applied science internship at big tech is the goal
To do that, realize that low hiring is a blocker to getting interviews. Use hiring pyramid to get interviews (roles are filled internally first), and understand levels that can influence getting an interview (L5:none, L6:in org, L7:in broader org, L8+:mostly anywhere)
Concurrently, apply! And practice coding (todo understand what else is needed to pass interviews)

Met with Swati, todo transcribe audio message of advice 
Decided this really is the summer of writing; at IC, Connor etc helping me write effectively (ex: have crisp definitions/glossary at start, discuss, then move forward)

AR: spend part of the rest of the summer understanding finance through writing: analyzing markets with Swati reviewing my writing to start.
Possibly ask Connor, Nick M, Preston to review finance-related writing too 

AR: decide to spend time reading the book Noah recommended about writing well
